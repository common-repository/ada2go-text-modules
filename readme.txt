== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What the hell is this good for? =

With the help of categories and individual text modules, you can create your own text generator for different uses. For example, you can create reviews for customers or participants without having to retype or copy the text over and over again.

= Which functions are still planned? =

We want to expand the shortcode that special categories can be included or excluded. We don't rename the reslut-safes folder ;-)
